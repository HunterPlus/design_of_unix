        Figure 5.13 Algorithm for Making New Node
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
algorithm make new node 
inputs: node (file name)
        file type
        permissions
        major, minor device number (for block, character special files)
output: none
{
        if (new node not named pipe and user not super user)
                return (error)
        get inode of parent of new node (algorithm namei);
        if (new node already exists) {
                release parent inode (algorithm iput);
                return (error);
        }
        assign free inode from file system for new node (algorithm ialloc);
        create new directory entry in parent directory: include new node
                        name and newly assigned inode number;
        release parent directory inode (algorithm iput);
        if (new node is block or character special file)
                write major, minor numbers into inode structure;
        release new node inode (algorithm iput);
