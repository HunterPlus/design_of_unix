        Figure 4.19 Algorithm for Allocating Disk Block
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
algorithm alloc         /* file system block allocation */
input:  file system number
output: buffer for new block
{
        while (super block locked)
                sleep(event super block not locked);
        remove block from super block free list;
        if (removed last block from free list) {
                lock super block;
                read block just taken from free list (algorithm bread);
                copy block numbers in block into super block;
                release block buffer (algorithm brelse);
                unlock super block;
                wake up processes (event super block not locked);
        }
        get buffer for block removed from super block list (algorithm getblk);
        zero buffer contents;
        decrement total count of free blocks;
        mark super block modified;
        return buffer;
