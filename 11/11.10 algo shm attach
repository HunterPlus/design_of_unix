        Figure 11.10 Algorithm for Attaching Shared Memory
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
algorithm shmat         /* attach shared memory */
input:  (1) shared memory descriptor
        (2) virtual address to attach memory
        (3) flags
output: virtual address where memory was attached
{
        check validity of descriptor, permissions;
        if (user specified virtual address) {
                round off virtual address, as specified by flags;
                check legality of virtual address, size of region;
        } else          /* user wants kernel to find good address */
                kernel picks virtual address: error if none available;
        attach region to process address space (algorithm attachreg);
        if (region being attached for first time)
                allocate page tables, memory for region (algorithm growreg);
        return (virtual address where attached);
