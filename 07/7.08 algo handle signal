algorithm psig          /* handle signals after recognizing their existence */
input:  none
output: none
{
        get signal number set in process table entry;
        clear signal number in process table entry;
        if (user had called signal sys call to ignore this signal)

                get user virtual address of signal catcher stored in u area;
                /* the next statement has undesirable side-effects */
                clear u area entry that stored address of signal catcher,
                modify user level context:
                                artificially create user stack frame to mimic
                                call to signal catcher function;
                modify system level context:
                                write address of signal catcher into program
                                counter field of user saved register context;
                return;
        }
        if (signal is type that system should dump core image of process) {
                create file named "core" in current directory;
                write contents of user level context to file "core";
        }
        invoke exit algorithm immediately;
