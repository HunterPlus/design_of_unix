        Figure 7.16 Algorithm for Wait
-----------------------------------------------------------------
algorithm wait
input:  address of variable to store status of exiting process
output: child ID, child exit code
{
        if (waiting process has no child process)
                return (error);
        for (;;) {      /* loop until return from inside loop */
                if (waiting process has zombie child) {
                        pick arbitrary zombie child;
                        add child CPU usage to parent;
                        free child process table entry;
                        return (child ID, child exit code);
                }
                if (process has no children)
                        return error;
                sleep at interruptible priority (event child process exits);
        }
