        Figure 7.14 Algorithm for Exit
---------------------------------------------------------------
algorithm exit
input:  return code for parent process
output: none
{
        ignore all signals;
        if (process group leader with associated control terminal) {
                send hangup signal to all members of process group;
                reset process group for all members to 0;
        }
        close all open files (internal version of algorithm close);
        release current directory (algorithm iput);
        release current (changed) root, if exists (algorithm iput);
        free regions, memory associated with process (algorith freereg);
        write accounting record;
        make process state zombie;
        assign parent process ID of all child processes to be init process (1);
                if any children were zombie, sen death of child signal to init;
        send death of child signal to parent process;
        context switch;
}
