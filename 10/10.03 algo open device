        Figure 10.3 Algorithm for Opening a Device
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
algorithm open          /* for device drivers */
input:  pathname
        openmode
output: file descriptor
{
        convert pathname to inode, increment inode reference count,
        allocate entry in file table, user file descriptor,
                        as in open of regular file;
        
        get major, minor number from inode;
        save context (algorithm setjmp) in case of long jump from driver;
        if (block device) {
                use major number as index to block device switch table;
                call driver open procedure for index:
                                pass minor number, open modes;
        } else {
                muse major number as index to character device switch table;
                call driver open procedure for index:
                                pass minor number, open modes;
        }
        if (open fails in driver)
                decrement file table, inode counts;
