        Figure 6.12 Algorithm for System Calls
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
algorithm syscall               /* algorithm for invocation of system call */
input:  system call number
output: result of system call
{
        find entry in system call table corresponding to system call number;
        determine number of parameters to system call;
        copy parameters from user address space to u area;
        save current context for abortive return (described in section 6.4.4);
        invoke system call code in kernel;
        if (error during execution of system call) {
                set register 0 in user save register context to error number;
                turn on carry bit in PS register in user saved register context;
        } else
                set registers 0, 1 in user saved register context
                                to return values from system call;
