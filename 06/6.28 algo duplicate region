	Figure 6.28 Algorithm for Dupreg
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
algorithm dupreg		/* duplicate an existing region */
input:	pointer to region table entry
output:	pointer to a region that looks identical to input region
{
	if (region type shared) 
		/* caller will increment region reference count 
		 * with subsequent attachreg call
		 */
		return (input region pointer);
	allocate new region (algorithm allocreg);
	set up auxiliary memory management structures, as currently
			exists in input region;
	allocate physical memory for region contents;
	"copy" region contents from input region to newly allocated region;
	return (pointer to allocated region);
}
