--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
algorithm wakeup		/* wake up a sleeping process */
input:	sleep address
output:	none
{
	raise processor execution level to block all interrupts;
	find sleep hash queue for sleep address;
	for (every process asleep on sleep address) {
		remove process from hash queue;
		mark process state "ready to run";
		put process on scheduler list of processes ready to run;
		clear field in process table entry for sleep address;
		if (process not loaded in memory)
			wake up swapper process (0);
		else if (awakened process is more eligible to run than
				currently running process)
			set scheduler flag;		
	}
	restore processor execution level to original level;
