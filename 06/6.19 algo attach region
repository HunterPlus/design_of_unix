	Figure 6.19 Algorithm for Attachreg
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
algorithm attachreg		/* attach a region to a process */
input:	(1) pointer to (locked) region being attached
	(2) process to which region is being attached
	(3) virtual address in process where region will be attached
	(4) region type
output:	per process region table entry
{
	allocate per process region table entry for process;
	initialize per process region table entry:
		set pointer to region being attached;
		set type field;
		set virtual address field;
	check legality of virtual address, region size;
	increment region reference count;
	increment process size according to attached region;
	initialize new hardware register triple for process;
	return (per process region table entry);
}
