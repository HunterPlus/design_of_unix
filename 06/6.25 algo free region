	Figure 6.25 Algorithm for Freeing a Region
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
algorithm freereg		/* free an allocated region */
input:	pointer to a (locked) region
output:	none
{
	if (region reference count non zero) {
		/* some process still using region */
		release region lock;
		if (region has associated inode)
			release inode lock;
		return;
	}
	if (region has associated inode)
		release inode (algorithm iput);
	free physical memory still associated with region;
	free auxiliary tables associated with region;
	clear region fields;
	place region on region free list;
	unlock region;
