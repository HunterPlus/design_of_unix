	Figure 6.23 Algorithm for Loadreg
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
algorithm loadreg		/* load a portion of a file into a region */
input:	(1) pointer to per process region table entry
	(2) virtual address to load region
	(3) inode pointer of file for loading region
	(4) byte offset in file for start of region
	(5) byte count for amount of data to load
output:	none
{
	increase region size according to eventual size of region
			(algorithm grow reg);
	mark region state: being loaded into memory;
	unlock region;
	set up u area parameters for reading file:
		target virtual address where data is read to,
		start offset value for reading file,
		count of bytes to read from file.
	read file into region (internal variant of rad algorithm);
	lock region;
	mark region state: completely loaded into memory;
	awaken all processes waiting for region to be loaded;
}
