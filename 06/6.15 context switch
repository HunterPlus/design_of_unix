        Figure 6.15 Step for a Context Switch 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.      Decide whether to do a context switch, 
        and whether a context switch is permissible now.
2.      Save the context of the "old" process.
3.      Find the "best" process to schedule for execution,
        using the process scheduling algorithm in Chapter 8.
4.      Restore its context.
