        Figure 4.8 Conversion of Byte Offset to Block Number in File System
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
algorithm bmap          /* block map of logical file byte offset to file system block */
input:  (1) inode
        (2) byte offset
output: (1) block number in file system
        (2) byte offset into block
        (3) bytes of I/O in block
        (4) read ahead block number
{
        calculate logical block number in file from byte offset;
        calculate start byte in block for I/O;          /* output 2 */
        calculate number of bytes to copy to user;      /* output 3 */
        check if read-ahead applicable, mark inode;     /* output 4 */
        determine level of indirection;
        while (not at necessary level of indirection) {
                calculate index into inode or indirect block from 
                                logical block number in file;
                get disk block number from inode or indirect block;
                release buffer from previous disk read, if any (algorithm brelse);
                if (no more levels of indirection)
                        return (block number);
                read indirect disk block (algorithm bread);
                adjust logical block number in file according to level of indirection;
        }
