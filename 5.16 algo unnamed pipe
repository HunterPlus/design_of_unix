        Figure 5.16 Algorithm for Creation of (Unnamed) Pipes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
algorithm pipe 
input:  none
output: read file descriptor
        write file descriptor
{
        assign new inode from pipe device (algorithm ialloc);
        allocate file table entry for reading, another for writing;
        initialize file table entries to point to new inode;
        allocate user file descriptor for reading, another for writing,
                        initialize to point to respective file table entries;
        set inode reference count to 2;
        initialize count of inode readers, wirters to 1;
